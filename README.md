# Note-Application

Welcome to the Note Application! This app allows you to store and manage your notes directly on your local machine using an MSSQL Database. Here's how it works:

## Blazor Server with Entity Framework: I've built this application using Blazor Server and Entity Framework, making it easy to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your notes.

Adding and Editing Notes: In the Index page, you'll find a simple form where you can write the title and content of your note. After saving, you can view all your saved notes in the FetchData page, where each note is displayed with its title, content, and the date and time it was saved.

## Editing Notes: If you need to update a note, simply click the "Edit" button on the FetchData page. This will allow you to modify both the title and content of the note. Once you're done editing, just click "Save" to update the note, and the date and time will automatically be refreshed.

Enjoy organizing your thoughts with the Note Application!
